## **About Me!**
My name is Satya Ananda, born at Jakarta in December 2002. I'm studying Computer Engineering @ Universitas Indonesia (2nd year). My passion in programming rose when I was a 2nd year student at my public high school. I was chosen-and-classified to be one of the school's representatives for the National Science Olympiad (OSN/KSN, known natively) in the field of Informatics. **This is my personal GitHub account.**

My interest in the field includes:
- Game Development
- Reverse Engineering
- Software Development
